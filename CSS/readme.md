# Mastodon Snippets: CSS

This section of the Mastodon Snippets repository is geared towards CSS-specific snippets. All of these snippets will work under vanilla Mastodon; compatible versions noted below.

## [Condense Notifications](https://github.com/psydwannabe/mastodon-snippets/blob/master/CSS/condense-notifications.css)

This snippet does exactly what it says on the tin. It condenses and deemphasizes favorites, boosts, and polls within the Mastodon notifications section in the vanilla Mastodon web client.

Please review the CSS file for more information on how this is accomplished.

**Compatible With:** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mastodon v2.0 -- v3.0.1

## [Hide Mastodon Footer Components](https://github.com/psydwannabe/mastodon-snippets/blob/master/CSS/hide-mastodon-footer-components.css)
This snippet removes the various Mastodon developer advertisements in the footer of the Mastodon public facing web pages (/about, /more, User Profiles).  I created this because I don't like advertising the exact version of server software my instance is running for security reasons. It also removes the developer-specific components that most users have no interest in, which cleans up the design and reduces confusion for less technical users.

**Compatible With:** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mastodon v2.0 -- v3.0.1

The footer has only 3 columns, and the data in those columns have been trimmed to 3 links: "Terms of Service", "Privacy Policy" and "About" - as well as the standard Mastodon logo in the center.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psydwannabe/mastodon-snippets/develop/CSS/hide-mastodon-footer-components-screenshot.png)
