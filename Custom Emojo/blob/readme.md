# Blob Emojo
The Blobs were originally created by Google in 2013 as part of Android KitKat. They moved on to worse things and left this behind licensed under the Apache license. The files here are custom and were never released by Google to my knowledge.

I made this vector from a 32px by 32px Mastodon emoji png file. It took me a long while to get all the lines to look right!
